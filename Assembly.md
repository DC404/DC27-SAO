Solder all six pins. Even though only th square pin (v3.3) and the pin directly under (GND) are used, this will help keep the badge connected better.

Attach the resistor near the sword. Direction doesn't matter.

Bend the leads apart to help hold the resistor in place while soldering.

Attach the LEDs near the eyes. Make sure the short lead is on the right, as indicated on the board.

They're going to shine so great.

If using a badge with the older SAO header, Mr. Fang needs to be aligned like in this picture.
